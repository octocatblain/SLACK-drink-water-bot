Slack bot: drink water reminder

## Requirements
A Slack bot will send messages to remind user to drink water periodically
- User can choose when the reminder will be triggered
- Start time (e.g. 9 AM)
- End time (e.g. 11 PM)
- Time interval (e.g. every hour

As an example, if the user chooses start time of 9 AM, end time of 11 PM, and a time interval of every hour, they'll receive notifications at 9 AM, 10 AM, 11 AM, and so forth until the last notification of the day at 11 PM.
User can specify the content of the reminder message

### For an extra challenge: 
Have the Slack bot interact with the user to take their inputs for the reminder message and times through Slack.
